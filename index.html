<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Recently graduated from Ryerson University with a degree in Computer Engineering and a 3.33 final year GPA. 
    During my studies at Ryerson I was drawn to coding which encouraged me to persue a career in software development. 
    In order to gain some real work experience I decided to take a deep dive into web development and do some freelance projects. 
    I am now looking for an entry level position to begin to learn and grow within the field. With the completion of my 4 year degree, 
    as well as my web development experience, I am dedicated and ready to embark on the next step in my career.</p>
